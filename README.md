Version of the Fizzbuzz kata based on an approach described by Llewelyn Falco. The approach is to write a single unit test of fizzbuzz from one to some value (Llewellyn said 20, but I used 30 to get to the many "fizzbuzz" result), and an extremely naive implementation that returns the expected output (no logic, just a giant string!) The next steps are to incrementally create an implementation, without changing the test in any way and keeping the tests passing throughout. 

The original idea was found on the Legacy Code Rocks podcast of May 4, 2017 "AATC 2017 Recap with Llewellyn Falco" at:
